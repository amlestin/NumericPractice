# NumericPractice
Small Java program to practice using the numeric row on keyboards

I started this project after finishing a Java class at university. 
It's meant to be a small, personally useful project that I can complete over the summer as a way to refine my programming skills.

Goals:
- Game mode and Learning mode
- Website version
- Add comments 
- Add sophisticaton
- Invite peer review
