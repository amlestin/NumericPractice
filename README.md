# NumericPractice
Small Java program to practice using the numeric row on keyboards

I started this project after finishing a Java class at university. 

It's meant to be a small, personally useful project that I can complete over the summer as a way to refine my programming skills. It is also intended to be a lot more responsive and bug-free than similar online solutions.

Goals:
- Game mode and Learning mode
- Downloadable
- Timers
- Sounds
- For numbers you have low accuracy with, you have to press and hold the number until you hear a happy chime
- Make the characters the user needs more practice with appear more often
- Add comments 
- Add sophisticaton
- Invite peer review
